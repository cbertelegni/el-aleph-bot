On the burning February morning Beatriz Viterbo died, 
after braving an agony that never for a single 
moment gave way to self-pity or fear, I noticed 
that the sidewalk billboards around Constitution 
Plaza were advertising some new brand or other 
of American cigarettes. The fact pained me, 
for I realised that the wide and ceaseless 
universe was already slipping away from her and 
that this slight change was the first of an 
endless series. The universe may change but not me, I 
thought with a certain sad vanity. I knew that 
at times my fruitless devotion had annoyed her; 
now that she was dead, I could devote myself to her memory
